# Assignment 2 – Concurrent Web Server in Go

**Course:** Advanced Programming 1  
**Assignment:** 2  
**Student:** Aldiyar Bazarbayev
**Group:** SE2416

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **concurrent web server** using the Go programming language and the standard `net/http` package.

The server supports multiple REST endpoints, safely handles concurrent requests using mutexes, runs a background worker using goroutines, and shuts down gracefully using context and OS signals.

The project demonstrates understanding of:
- Go concurrency model
- Goroutines and mutexes
- Context-based cancellation
- RESTful API design
- Clean project structure

### Structure Explanation

- `cmd/server` – contains the main package and application startup logic  
- `internal/server` – HTTP handlers, concurrency logic, background worker  
- `internal/storage` – thread-safe in-memory database  
- `go.mod` – Go module definition  

This structure follows standard Go project conventions.

---

## Technologies Used

- Go 1.22+
- net/http
- sync.Mutex
- Goroutines
- Context
- OS signal handling

No external libraries are used.

## API Endpoints

### POST /data

Stores key-value data in memory.

**Request body (JSON):**
```json
{
  "key": "value"
}


{
  "status": "stored"
}


GET /data

Returns all stored data.

Response:

{
  "name": "Artem",
  "city": "Samara"
}

DELETE /data/{key}

Deletes a value by key.

Response:

{
  "deleted": "name"
}
GET /stats

Returns server statistics.

Response:

{
  "total_requests": 5,
  "database_size": 1,
  "uptime_seconds": 42
}


Thread Safety
	•	All shared resources are protected using sync.Mutex
	•	The in-memory database is isolated in a separate storage layer
	•	Request counters and server stats are accessed safely
	•	The project passes Go race-condition checks



Background Worker

A background goroutine:
	•	Starts when the server starts
	•	Logs server statistics every 5 seconds
	•	Stops automatically when the server shuts down

Implemented using time.Ticker and context.Context.

Graceful Shutdown
	•	OS signals (Ctrl + C) are captured
	•	Active requests are allowed to complete
	•	Background worker stops cleanly
	•	Server shuts down without data corruption

Implemented using signal.NotifyContext and http.Server.Shutdown.


How to Run the Project

1. Check Go version

go version
2. Download dependencies

go mod tidy
3. Run the server

go run ./cmd/server
Server will start on:

http://localhost:8080
Example Testing Commands

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/data \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"Alice"}'
curl http://localhost:8080/data
curl http://localhost:8080/stats



Conclusion

This project fulfills all assignment requirements:

Concurrent web server
Thread-safe shared state
Background worker
Graceful shutdown
Clean and professional architecture
The solution is simple, reliable, and easy to maintain.
